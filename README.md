# New Baltimore Gazette â€“ News Plugin

## Goal
Adapt WordPress into a modern, online-only newspaper platform for the New Baltimore Gazette. This plugin adds core newsroom concepts (Sections, Fronts, Articles, Placements, Breaking Alerts) and a Gutenberg-first editorial experience.

## Status
- Version: 0.0.1
- Work-in-Progress: scaffolding architecture and editor surfaces.

## Highlights
- Gutenberg-only editing; block themes; hook/filter-first rendering.
- Custom post type `news`, hierarchical taxonomy `news_section`, optional `news_beat`.
- Configurable Fronts (home and section fronts) with placements for ads/promos.
- AI-friendly REST/meta exposure and JSON-LD.

## Documentation
- See `ARCHITECTURE.md` for system design, data model, and WP mapping.
 - See `ROADMAP.md` for milestones to the Nov 1 beta.
